Implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) only with Python and NumPy

- Question 3:
Implement a simple MLP with two layers that use the sigmoid and the softmax activation functions in Python. Perform a forward and backward pass

- Question 4:
Implement a training loop for the network

- Question 5:
Use NumPy to re-write the functions of the network. Run the network for the MNIST data

- Question 6:
Implement a vectorized version of a batched forward and backward pass using NumPy
